# Introduction

## Research Objectives

1. **Stationarity:**
   Do the biophysical rules of a forest in the Pacific Northwest hold true in the Deep South?

2. **Spatial Leakage:**
   Does including Latitude and Longitude create a robust model, or a fragile one that cannot generalize?

## The `forested` Package

**Speaker Notes:**
* The `forested` package is our primary data source, containing the raw measurements for both the Washington and Georgia "islands".
* We are auditing this package's features to see how well they predict the 'forested' outcome in two geographically distant locations.

## The Autocorrelation Trap{text-align="center"}

<br>
<br>
<br>

>"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."
> — Waldo Tobler (1970)


::: {.notes}

- This is the "First Law of Geography" and explains why our Random Forest "cheats" using Lat/Lon.

- Proximity Bias (Spatial Autocorrelation) creates high local accuracy but zero portability.

- We are testing for **Stationarity**: Do the biophysical rules of Washington still work in Georgia?

## The Goal of Prediction {text-align="center"}

<br/>

> "The fundamental goal of a model is not to describe the data we have, but to predict the data we don't."
>
> — Max Kuhn & Kjell Johnson, *Applied Predictive Modeling*

::: {.notes}

- This quote from Kuhn and Johnson is the foundation of our entire project.
- If our model doesn't generalize to the "second island" (Georgia), it has failed its fundamental goal.

### Drivers of Growth
* **Washington**: Topographically driven; governed by orographic lift and rain shadows.
* **Georgia**: Climatically driven; limited by seasonal moisture stress and drainage.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Site Constraints
* **WA**: Timberline limits and cold (cryic) soil regimes.
* **GA**: Highly weathered acidic Ultisols and bottomland saturation.

::: {.notes}
**Speaker Notes:**
* **Washington**: Forestation is restricted by the Cascade rain shadow and high-elevation cold.
* **Georgia**: Patterns are a mosaic of agricultural land use and timber production on red clay (Ultisols).

:::{.notes}
- Ecoregions denote areas with similar ecosystems and resources.
- The EPA defines 105 Level III regions for management.
- James Omernik drew these lines using holistic expert synthesis.
- Washington and Georgia share zero common ecoregions.
- Washington transitions rapidly from rainforests to arid deserts.
- This extreme heterogeneity makes random spatial modeling difficult.

**1. Topic Introduction**

- This slide presents a univariate audit of our numeric predictors to identify which biophysical features provide the strongest signal for forestation.

- By comparing the "fingerprints" of forested (green) and non-forested (brown) plots, we can visually assess the potential for classification before we begin training models on our EPYC VM.

**2. Axis Definitions**
- **The X-Axis (Value)**: Represents the measurement for each specific biophysical variable, such as millimeters of rain or degrees Celsius.
- **The Y-Axis (Density)**: Represents the probability density for a given value; higher peaks indicate a higher frequency of observations at that specific value within the dataset.

**3. Significant Variables (High Contrast)**
- **Precipitation (`precip_annual`)**: This is a primary driver; forested plots are heavily concentrated in higher rainfall zones, while non-forested plots dominate the dry end of the spectrum.
- **Elevation**: There is a distinct "Forestation Window"; plots between 1,000 and 2,000 meters show a significant green peak, whereas non-forested plots cluster at lower elevations.
- **Temperature (`temp_annual_max` & `mean`)**: Forested plots consistently peak at lower maximum and mean temperatures compared to non-forested areas, suggesting a thermal threshold for forest growth.
- **Vapor Pressure (`vapor_max` & `min`)**: We see a strong bimodal separation; forested areas occupy a specific atmospheric moisture niche distinctly different from non-forested regions.

**4. Non-Significant Variables (High Overlap)**
- **Orientation (`eastness` & `northness`)**: These distributions are nearly identical for both classes, suggesting that cardinal direction alone is a weak predictor in this regional regime.
- **Roughness**: While there is a slight lean toward forested plots being in rougher terrain, the massive overlap indicates surface texture is not a primary discriminator.

::: {.notes}
**1. Topic Introduction**
* This map visualizes our "3-Sigma" outliers, which are heavily concentrated along the mountainous west side of the state.

**2. The Orographic Factor**
* The concentration on the west is driven by the Cascades and Olympics. These regions host our most extreme biophysical values for precipitation and elevation.

**3. Intermixed Extremes**
* Note the intermixing of green and brown points. In these high-volatility alpine zones, a forest and a barren ridge often share the same coordinates.
* This proves that local "nearness" is not enough to predict forestation here; the model must rely on the specific biophysical drivers we identified in our density distributions.

**4. The Audit Link**
* These outliers represent the "edge cases" of our Washington model. Their intermixed nature makes them the hardest points to classify, serving as a preview for our Georgia transfer test.

## Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
#| label: pca
tar_read(plt_wa_pca)
```

::: {.notes}
**1. What is PCA?**

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction tool that takes our 16 variables—including latitude, longitude, and climate data—and compresses them into two primary axes called Principal Components. It allows us to view the 'shape' of the entire Washington dataset in a single 2D space.

**2. Why use it here?**

We use it to explore the structural integrity of our data. Before building a model, we need to know if the environment of 'Forested' plots is actually mathematically different from 'Non-Forested' plots. By including lat and lon, we are seeing the combined power of geography and biophysics.

**3. Does it show anything?**

It shows that the data is not a random cloud; it has a clear orientation. The spread along PC1 captures the primary environmental gradient of Washington—likely moving from the moist coast to the arid east. 

**4. Is there good separation on the outcome variable?**

Yes, the separation is significant. We see a distinct 'No' (Non-Forested) cluster forming a tail on the right and a dense 'Yes' (Forested) cluster on the left. While there is 'Alpine Mixing' in the center where categories overlap, the two groups occupy mostly different regions of the feature space.

**5. What does it foreshadow for modeling?**

This separation foreshadows high accuracy for our local Washington model. Because the classes are so distinct in this space, a logistic regression should have no trouble drawing a boundary between them. However, the tight coupling of biophysics with coordinates (lat/lon) here warns us that the model might 'memorize' Washington's map, which will be the primary challenge when we attempt to transfer it to Georgia.

## Correlogram

```{r}
#| label: correlogram
tar_read(plt_correlogram)
```

::: {.notes}
**1. Orientation**
- If you look at the very first column on the left, we can see exactly what drives our "Forested" classification.
- Blue means "More Forest," Orange means "Less Forest."

**2. The Sanity Check**
- First, look at the bottom square: **Canopy Cover (0.75)**.
- This is our sanity check. Obviously, forests have high canopy cover. If this wasn't blue, our data would be broken.

**3. The Biophysical Story: Water vs. Heat**
- The real story is the battle between water and heat.
- **Precipitation (0.52)** is a strong blue driver. In Washington, rain equals trees.
- **Vapor Pressure (-0.64)** is a deep orange driver. High vapor pressure—which correlates with hot, dry valleys—effectively kills the forest probability.

**4. The Terrain Factor**
- Look at **Roughness (0.39)**.
- Rugged, difficult terrain is more likely to be forested. This is likely a mix of biophysics (mountains catch rain) and human history (flat land gets cleared for farming).

**5. The Surprise**
- Finally, look at **Northness and Eastness**. They are near **zero**.
- This tells us that while the *direction* a slope faces might change *which* trees grow there, it doesn't determine *if* trees grow there.

## VIP

::: {.notes}
**1. The Comparison**

- "We just looked at Correlations (linear relationships). Now let's look at Variable Importance via Random Forest. This is what the model actually uses to make decisions."

**2. The Consistency**

- "The top three are the same: Canopy Cover, Rain, and Aridity (Vapor Pressure). This confirms our model is learning real biophysics."

**3. Spatial Factors**

- "But look at number 4: **Longitude**."

- "In the correlation chart, Longitude was just a moderate factor. Here, it is massive."

- "The model has learned that Washington is divided into two distinct climate zones—West and East."

- "Instead of learning the physics of *why* trees grow there, it's partially just memorizing *where* they grow. This confirms our hypothesis: the model is using geography as a shortcut. And is worth remembering when we apply it to the Georgia data.

# Resampling

## Spatial Autocorrelation

>"When data are not independent (e.g. due to spatial autocorrelation), random cross-validation yields optimistic estimates of predictive performance because training and test sets are not independent."[@roberts_crossvalidation_2017]

:::{.notes}
**1. Translation of the Quote**

This quote describes the "Golden Rule" of geography: "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."

**2. Definition: Spatial Autocorrelation**

Spatial Autocorrelation just means that data points close to each other are practically clones. If it's raining at your house, it's probably raining at your neighbor's house.

**3. forested dataset**

Forests are "clumpy." If you stand next to a Douglas Fir in Washington and take one step to the left, you are almost certainly still in a forest. The elevation, soil, and rain are identical.

**4. Why Random CV is "Optimistic" (The Cheating)**

- When the standard **Random Cross-Validation** is used, the first tree is assigned to the "Study Group" and the second tree (one step away) to the "Test Group."

- The model doesn't learn ecology. It just looks at the neighbor (lat and lon) and copies the answer.

- This gives us an **"Optimistic Estimate"**—a fancy way of saying our high score was fake because the model was cheating off its neighbor.

```

::: {.notes}
**1. Left Panel: Random CV (The Illusion of Accuracy)**
- This visualizes why Random CV yields **over-optimistic estimates**.
- Because the colors are mixed (Random), the model can accurately predict a "Red" point simply by memorizing the "Blue" point next to it.
- This isn't "true" predictive power; it is **autocorrelation leakage**. The model is interpolating neighbors rather than learning the underlying ecological rules.

**2. Middle Panel: Spatial Blocking (Forcing Independence)**
- To get a **realistic assessment**, we must enforce spatial independence.
- The grid structure ensures that the test data (Red blocks) is geographically distinct from the training data.
- The performance score will likely drop compared to the first map, but that lower score is **more accurate**. It reflects how the model will actually perform on a new, unvisited site.

**3. Right Panel: Environmental Clustering (Testing Generalization)**
- This strategy tests for **ecological generalization**.
- Notice the large red area in the southeast—the algorithm identified the **Columbia Plateau** as a distinct environment.
- By holding out entire environments (e.g., training on "Wet Coastal" to predict "Dry Plateau"), we test if the model captures the fundamental biological relationships (e.g., how temp/rain affect trees) rather than just memorizing geographic trends.
